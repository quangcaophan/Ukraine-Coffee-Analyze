## SCENARIO
You are on the data science team for a coffee company that is looking to expand their business into Ukraine. They want to get an understanding of the existing coffee shop market there.

You have a dataset from Google businesses. It contains information about coffee shops in Ukraine. The marketing manager wants to identify the key coffee shop segments. They will use this to construct their marketing plan. In their current location, they split the market into 5 segments. The marketing manager wants to know how many segments are in this new market, and their key features.

You will be presenting your findings to the Marketing Manager, who has no data science background.

## ASK
- Question:

1. Compare which city has the most rating and reviews.
2. Compare which place type has the most popular.
3. Compare Reviews of Place Type when it comes to Dine In Option.
4. Compare Reviews of Place Type when it comes to Takeout options.
5. How many shops provides all services, delivery, dine-in, and takeout options.

## Process
First We had load and print the top five rows of our Dataset in the above cell. Then to get to more information on our data about the dataset

```python
df.info()
```
```
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
RangeIndex: 200 entries, 0 to 199
Data columns (total 9 columns):
 #   Column           Non-Null Count  Dtype  
---  ------           --------------  -----  
 0   Region           200 non-null    object 
 1   Place name       200 non-null    object 
 2   Place type       200 non-null    object 
 3   Rating           198 non-null    float64
 4   Reviews          198 non-null    float64
 5   Price            122 non-null    object 
 6   Delivery option  129 non-null    object 
 7   Dine in option   140 non-null    object 
 8   Takeout option   144 non-null    object 
dtypes: float64(2), object(7)
memory usage: 14.2+ KB
```

```python
df.isna().sum()
```
```
Region              0
Place name          0
Place type          0
Rating              2
Reviews             2
Price              78
Delivery option    71
Dine in option     60
Takeout option     56
dtype: int64
```

```python
# Take a look at the variables despite the missing values
print(df['Price'].unique())
print(df['Delivery option'].unique())
print(df['Takeout option'].unique())
print(df['Dine in option'].unique())
```
```
[nan '$$' '$' '$$$']
[nan False True]
[nan True]
[nan True]
```

We will replace the missing values with the average of the Rating and Reviews columns
The values of the remaining columns are Boolean and Symbolic values and cannot be averaged
1. Price value will be deleted due to not providing enough information
2. The Distribution column is neither "True" nor "False", this analysis replaces missing values with "unknown".
3. For dine-in and takeout services, the variables in these columns are the value "True" and the value is missing. Therefore, it is clear that the missing values must be "False", which means that the stores do not offer dine-in or take-out options.

```python
df['Rating'] = df['Rating'].fillna(df['Rating'].mean())
df['Reviews'] = df['Reviews'].fillna(df['Reviews'].mean())


df = df.drop("Price",axis=1)
df['Delivery option'] = df['Delivery option'].fillna("Unknow")
df['Dine in option'] = df['Dine in option'].fillna("False")
df['Takeout option'] = df['Takeout option'].fillna("False")
df.isna().sum()
```
```
Region             0
Place name         0
Place type         0
Rating             0
Reviews            0
Delivery option    0
Dine in option     0
Takeout option     0
dtype: int64
```

We will convert Reviews to int to make it easier to calculate later

```python
df['Reviews'] = df['Reviews'].astype('int')
df.info()
```
```
<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>
RangeIndex: 200 entries, 0 to 199
Data columns (total 8 columns):
 #   Column           Non-Null Count  Dtype

## ANALYZE
We will now perform a descriptive analysis of the data

Before we begin the analysis, it is a good idea to review basic descriptive statistics about the data.
```python
df.describe()
```

|     | Rating    | Reviews     |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
|count|	200.000000|	200.000000  |
|mean |	4.663636  |	622.490000  |
|std  |	0.220531  |	1393.841198 |
|min  |	3.900000  |	3.000000    |
|25%  |	4.600000  |	48.500000   |
|50%  |	4.700000  |	277.000000  |
|75%  |	4.800000  |	780.750000  |
|max  |	5.000000  |	17937.000000|

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(20,16))# Width and Height of figure
sns.set_style("darkgrid")
plt.style.use('ggplot') 
plt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.4, wspace=0.6)
sns.set_palette("Spectral")
for i, cat_col in enumerate(['Place type', 'Delivery option', 'Dine in option', 'Takeout option']):
    plt.subplot(3, 2, i+1)
    sns.countplot(y=cat_col, 
                  data=df, 
                  order=df[cat_col].value_counts().index,
                  palette="rocket")
    plt.title(cat_col)
    plt.xticks(rotation=0)
plt.show()
```
<p align="center">
  <img src="/IMG/1.png">

Reagarding the plots above, most places are coffee shops. Most of them do not have a delivery service but have dine-in and take-out options

#### Q1: Compare which city has the most rating and reviews.

```python
# Sort the Rating as per Region
rating_group = df.groupby("Region").mean().sort_values("Rating",ascending=False).round(2)
# Since we have used groupby, we will have to reset the index to add the product category into dataframe 
rating_group.reset_index(inplace= True)

plt.figure(figsize = (20,5)) # Width and Height of figure
sns.set_style("darkgrid")
sns.barplot(x = "Region",
            y = "Rating",
            data = rating_group,
            palette="rocket")
plt.xlabel("Region",size = 12) # x axis show the Region
plt.ylabel("Rating",size = 12) # y axis show the Rating
plt.title("City has the most Rating",size = 12)
for k,v in rating_group["Rating"].items(): # To show the exact Rating generated on the figure
    plt.text(k,v,str(v),
             fontsize = 12,
             color = 'k', 
             horizontalalignment = 'center')

sns.despine()
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="/IMG/2.png">

```python
# Sort the Reviews as per Region
reviews_group = df.groupby("Region").sum().sort_values("Reviews",ascending=False).round(2)
# Since we have used groupby, we will have to reset the index to add the product category into dataframe 
reviews_group.reset_index(inplace= True)

plt.figure(figsize = (20,5)) # Width and Height of figure
sns.set_style("darkgrid")
sns.barplot(x = "Region",
            y = "Reviews",
            data = reviews_group,
            palette="rocket")
plt.xlabel("Region",size = 12) # x axis show the Region
plt.ylabel("Reviews",size = 12) # y axis show the Reviews
plt.title("City has the most Reviews",size = 12)
for k,v in reviews_group["Reviews"].items(): # To show the exact Reviews generated on the figure
    plt.text(k,v,str(v),
             fontsize = 12,
             color = 'k', 
             horizontalalignment = 'center')
sns.despine()
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="/IMG/3.png">

Through the 2 bar charts above, we see that Kiev is the city with the highest Rating and Lviv is the city with the highest Reviews.

#### Q2. Compare which place type has the most popular.

```python
ordered = list(df["Place type"].value_counts().index)# To sort the place type

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
fig.set_size_inches(20,5)# Width and Height of figure
sns.set_style("darkgrid")
sns.countplot(y = "Place type",
              data = df,
              order= ordered,
              palette="rocket")
plt.xlabel("Count",size = 12)# x axis show the Count
plt.ylabel("Place type",size = 12)# y axis show the Place type
plt.title("Number of Place Type in Ukraine", size=14)
ax.bar_label(ax.containers[0],fontsize = 12)# To show the exact Value generated on the figure
sns.despine()
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="/IMG/4.png">

As We can look at the upper bar graph We can easily see that Coffee shop is the most popular in Ukraine, Also Cafe then Espresso bar.

#### Q3. Compare Reviews of Place Type when it comes to Dine In Option.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(20,5))# Width and Height of figure
sns.set_style("darkgrid")
sns.barplot(x = 'Reviews',
            y = "Place type",
            hue = "Dine in option",
            data = df,
            palette = "rocket",
            ci = 0)
plt.xlabel("Reviews",size = 12)# x axis show the Reviews
plt.ylabel("Place type",size = 12)# y axis show the Place type
plt.title("No Of Reviews According To Place Type With Respect To Dine in option",size = 12)
sns.despine()
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="/IMG/5.png">

In the Bar graph present above we can easily see that Chocolate shop and Europe restaurant are getting most number of reviews with respect to Dine in option 

However coffee shops are not so much famous in Dine in that is why they are getting less number of reviews than Chocolate shop, European Restaurant, Pastry shop and Coffee roasters.

#### Q4. Compare Reviews of Place Type when it comes to Takeout Option.

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(18.5,5))# Width and Height of figure
sns.set_style("darkgrid")
sns.barplot(x = 'Place type',
            y = "Reviews",
            hue = "Takeout option",
            data = df,
            palette = "rocket",
            ci = 0)
plt.xlabel("Place type",size = 12)# x axis show the Place type
plt.ylabel("Reviews",size = 12)# y axis show the Reviews
plt.xticks(rotation = 40)
plt.title("No Of Reviews According To Place Type With Respect To Takeout option",size = 12)
sns.despine()
```
<p align="center">
  <img src="/IMG/6.png">

In the Bar graph present above We can easily see that Chocolate shop and Pastry shop are getting most number of reivews when Takeout option is available 

Also Coffee roasters and Restaurants are generating a good number of reviews when takeout option is available however Coffee shop which is having the most number of shops in Ukraine are not so famous in the takeout option as well. 

Also European Restaurant is still generating the second highest number of reviews also when takeout option is not available...However we can clearly observe that people tends more likely to give reviews when Takeout option is available.

```python
#To filter shop with all the service option
deliver = df['Delivery option'] == True
dinein = df['Dine in option'] == True
takeout = df['Takeout option'] == True

#To create a column that shop with all the service option 
all_service = df[deliver & dinein & takeout].groupby("Region").count()
all_service['all_service'] = all_service[['Delivery option', 'Dine in option', 'Takeout option']].mean(axis= 1)
all_service.reset_index(inplace = True)

#To create a table where the Reviews are filtered by the shop with all the options
Rating_by_all_service = df[deliver & dinein & takeout].groupby('Region')['Rating'].sum()
Rating_by_all_service.reset_index()

```
|Region       |	Rating  |
|-------------|---------|
|	Dnipro      |	13.8    |
|	Kharkiv     |	9.2     |
|	Kherson     |	9.2     |
|	Khrivoy Rog |	18.0    |
|	Kiev        |	4.6     |
|	Lviv        |	14.3    |
|	Mariupol    |	18.8    |
|	Odessa      |	9.2     |
|	Poltava     |	4.5     |
|	Zaporozhye  |	5.0     |

```python
matplotlib.rc_file_defaults()
ax1 = sns.set_style("darkgrid")
fig, ax1 = plt.subplots(figsize=(20,6))
sns.lineplot(data = Rating_by_all_service, 
             marker='o', 
             sort = False, 
             ax=ax1)

ax2 = ax1.twinx()
sns.barplot(y = "all_service",
            x = "Region",
            data = all_service,
            palette = "rocket", 
            alpha = 0.5,
            ax=ax2)

ax1.set_xlabel("Region")# x axis show the Region
ax1.set_ylabel("Rating")# y axis show the Reviews
ax2.set_ylabel("Number of shop")# y axis show the Number of shop

```
<p align="center">
  <img src="/IMG/7.png">

As we can see in the chart above, Khrivoy Rog and Mariupol are the two cities with the most stores with all options. Followed by Lviv and Dnipro 2nd most.

But when looking at the ratings of cities, we can see that Mariupol has the highest Rating and cities with 1 store with all options are quite low.

This means that the Delivery option, Dine in option and Takeout option are related to the Rating of the store.

## ACT
For the last step in the data analysis process, we will make three recommendations. But first, we'll lay out three key insights.

#### Key Findings:
- Coffee shops are the most popular in Ukraine, followed by cafes and espresso bars.
- Kiev has the highest rating while Lviv has the highest number of reviews.
- Chocolate shops and European restaurants are popular for dine-in options while chocolate shops and pastry shops are popular for take-out options.
- Khrivoy Rog and Mariupol have the most stores with all options (delivery, dine-in, and take-out) while Mariupol has the highest rating.

#### Recommendations:
- Coffee shops in Ukraine could consider adding delivery services to increase their popularity and reach more customers.
- Coffee shops could also focus on improving their dine-in and take-out options to attract more customers and generate more reviews.
- Stores in cities with only one store with all options could consider adding more options to improve their ratings.
